    <abstract>
        <t>Given the current global COVID-19 pandemic of 2019, there is a need
          to be more careful to prevent the spread of contagious pathogens. To
          that end, physical contact, like handshakes, must be avoided. So,
          the TCP handshake must go!</t>

        is a very important transport layer protocol on the Internet. The
        process of establishing a TCP connection is called the "three-way
        handshake." This process is defined in
        <xref target="RFC0793">section 3.4 of</xref>. Handshaking requires
        physical contact. For viruses like COVID-19, handshaking promotes more
        efficient spread. As such, handshaking MUST be eliminated. It really
        is that simple.</t>

      <name>TCP Handshakes</name>
      <t>The process of establishing a connection in TCP is called the
        "three-way handshake" and is defined in
        <xref target="RFC0793">section 3.4 of</xref>. At a high level, the
        handshake process looks like this:</t>

  |----syn---->|
  |            |

  |----ack---->|
  |            |
  |    ...     |
        ]]></artwork>
      </figure>
      <t>The connection establishment synchronizes the sequence numbers and
        other important connection parameters for each direction of the
        connnection.</t>
      <t>The TCP RFC was written before there was a commercial presence on
        the Internet. Connections were being established (and dropped) long
        before the fall of the Berlin Wall. In all that time, the handshake
        has been serving without much scrutiny. In fact, many vendors have
        even put their own unique spin on it. For example, Avaya used to
        require two acks from a client. The client had to be double sure
        they wanted to connect.</t>
      <t>In this time of world pandemic, it is time to reconsider many things
        we've taken for granted. TCP handshakes are but one thing we need
        to reconsider.</t>

      <name>IANA Considerations</name>
      <t>If this work is standardized, IANA is asked to find and obsolete all
        TCP related RFCs. I know it may seem weird to have IANA do this, but
        I don't wanna do that work, and I'd hate to give RFC editors any
        more work.</t>

    <section>
      <name>Existential Considerations</name>
      <t>Without a handshake, "connections", sessions, sequence numbers, and ACKs
          for every packet is TCP really TCP?  While sending large numbers of max
          size datagrams in a single "connection" is the enemy of flow based 5 
          tuple ECMP flow hashing (which cannot differentiate between an 8k video 
          stream and a ping), it is how traditional TCP has operated for decades
          and how traditional RPCs between client and server is transacted over
          a wide variety of networks worldwide (wirelessa and wired).</t>
    </section>
    <section>
      <name>Concerning Satellite Communications</name>
      <t>So one advantage of dispensing with TCP handshakes is it eliminates the need
          for satellite TCP accelerators.  Traditionally TCP interprets latency as 
          non delivery if it does not receive ACKs without the window period.  Satellite
          comms are often so latent the ACKs do not make it in time resulting in the
          transmission of a number of duplicate packets.  Accelerators send fake ACKs 
          to the sender and suppresses ACKs from the receiver so the data flow is
          consistent.  Eliminating the ACKs and handshakes also eliminates the need 
          for accelerators.</t>

      <name>A Note on COVID-19</name>
      <t>This RFC was inspired by the
        <xref target="COVID-19">Novel Coronavirus 2019 pandemic</xref>. I'd
        like to take a moment to recognize that this disease is causing
        suffering for many people. Please take a moment to think about these
        people and anyone suffering such maladies in the future. Please
        consider contributing to charaties helping such people.</t>
