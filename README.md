# How This RFC Came to Be

Rachel, my beautiful and shockingly smart partner was sitting at her computer
one day looking through her feed on Facebook. She looked up and seemed very
delighted with herself when she told me this:

> We should moved everything on TCP to UDP because of COVID-19.

"What?" I said.

She said this:

> Because TCP has handshakes and UDP doesn't and handshakes spread COVID-19.

And...my brain blew up, and I put together this RFC with one of my techy friends.
