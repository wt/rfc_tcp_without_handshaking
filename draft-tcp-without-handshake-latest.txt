          TCP Without Handshakes to Avoid Contagious Pathogens
                     draft-tcp_without_handshake-01

Abstract

   Given the current global COVID-19 pandemic of 2019, there is a need
   to be more careful to prevent the spread of contagious pathogens.  To
   that end, physical contact, like handshakes, must be avoided.  So,
   the TCP handshake must go!

1.  Introduction

   Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) [RFC0793] is a very important
   transport layer protocol on the Internet.  The process of
   establishing a TCP connection is called the "three-way handshake."
   This process is defined in section 3.4 of [RFC0793].  Handshaking
   requires physical contact.  For viruses like COVID-19, handshaking
   promotes more efficient spread.  As such, handshaking MUST be
   eliminated.  It really is that simple.

1.1.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

2.  TCP Handshakes

   The process of establishing a connection in TCP is called the "three-
   way handshake" and is defined in section 3.4 of [RFC0793].  At a high
   level, the handshake process looks like this:

   Client      Server
     |            |
     |----syn---->|
     |            |
     |<--syn/ack--|
     |            |
     |----ack---->|
     |            |
     |    ...     |

                          Figure 1: TCP handshake

   The connection establishment synchronizes the sequence numbers and
   other important connection parameters for each direction of the
   connnection.

   The TCP RFC was written before there was a commercial presence on the
   Internet.  Connections were being established (and dropped) long
   before the fall of the Berlin Wall.  In all that time, the handshake
   has been serving without much scrutiny.  In fact, many vendors have
   even put their own unique spin on it.  For example, Avaya used to
   require two acks from a client.  The client had to be double sure
   they wanted to connect.

   In this time of world pandemic, it is time to reconsider many things
   we've taken for granted.  TCP handshakes are but one thing we need to
   reconsider.

3.  Solution: Replace TCP

   All implementations of TCP [RFC0793] must be replaced with UDP
   [RFC0768].

4.  Rejected Options

4.1.  TCP Fist Bump

   Still passes too many germs.

4.2.  TCP Elbow Bump

   Super awkward.

4.3.  TCP Jazz Hands

   You thought the elbow bump was awkward?

4.4.  QUIC

   [QUIC] isn't even a standard yet...c'mon.

5.  IANA Considerations

   If this work is standardized, IANA is asked to find and obsolete all
   TCP related RFCs.  I know it may seem weird to have IANA do this, but
   I don't wanna do that work, and I'd hate to give RFC editors any more
   work.

6.  Existential Considerations

   Without a handshake, "connections", sessions, sequence numbers, and
   ACKs for every packet is TCP really TCP?  While sending large numbers
   of max size datagrams in a single "connection" is the enemy of flow
   based 5 tuple ECMP flow hashing (which cannot differentiate between
   an 8k video stream and a ping), it is how traditional TCP has
   operated for decades and how traditional RPCs between client and
   server is transacted over a wide variety of networks worldwide
   (wirelessa and wired).

7.  Concerning Satellite Communications

   So one advantage of dispensing with TCP handshakes is it eliminates
   the need for satellite TCP accelerators.  Traditionally TCP
   interprets latency as non delivery if it does not receive ACKs
   without the window period.  Satellite comms are often so latent the
   ACKs do not make it in time resulting in the transmission of a number
   of duplicate packets.  Accelerators send fake ACKs to the sender and
   suppresses ACKs from the receiver so the data flow is consistent.
   Eliminating the ACKs and handshakes also eliminates the need for
   accelerators.

8.  A Note on COVID-19

   This RFC was inspired by the Novel Coronavirus 2019 pandemic
   [COVID-19].  I'd like to take a moment to recognize that this disease
   is causing suffering for many people.  Please take a moment to think
   about these people and anyone suffering such maladies in the future.
   Please consider contributing to charities helping such people.
